## PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The goal of the hackathon is to dive into real-world health data, uncover key insights about healthcare performance, and visualize these insights using Power BI. 
Participants were to use the provided dataset to analyze various health indicators, with a particular focus on mortality rates, disease prevalence, and healthcare access quality. 

The objective is to create compelling, data-driven stories and interactive dashboards that offer solutions and recommendations for improving healthcare outcomes.


## ANALYSIS FOCUS AREA

This analysis seeks to answer questions like:
Which health sectors are performing well, and where can improvements be made?
Which diseases are deadliest in terms of mortality relative to incidence?
What are the most dangerous conditions based on standardized death rates?
What are the top 5 diseases contributing to the highest mortality?


## ANALYSIS RESULTS

#### Key Metrics Overview

Here are the key global metrics from the analysis:

• Average Risk-Standardized Death Rate (RSD): 0.000695
• Average Mortality-to-Incidence (MI) Ratio: 0.36
• Average Health Access and Quality (HAQ) Index: 49.67
• Total Countries Analyzed: 204
• Total Diseases Analyzed: 32



#### Top 10 Most Dangerous Conditions

The following diseases have the highest standardized death rates, presenting the greatest threat globally:

1. Ischemic heart disease
2. Stroke
3. Lower respiratory infections
4. Chronic kidney disease
5. Neonatal disorders
6. Hypertensive heart disease
7. Measles							
8. Peptic ulcer disease
9. Rheumatic heart disease 			
10. Congenital heart anomalies


#### Mortality Trends by Age

Age-specific trends reveal significant variations in mortality rates. Key insights include:

• The post-working age group has the highest MI ratio (0.576).
• The working age group follows with an MI ratio of 0.375.



#### Top 5 Diseases Contributing to Highest Mortality

The following diseases contribute to the highest mortality rates globally:

1. Colon and rectum cancer
2. Hodgkin lymphoma
3. Cervical cancer
4. Breast cancer
5. Leukemia



#### Global Comparisons and Health Access Quality

The analysis also includes comparisons across different countries, providing a broad view of how health access and quality, mortality rates, and disease risk differ globally. Countries like Switzerland, Canada, and Australia score highly on the HAQ Index, while many developing nations experience significantly lower scores.
